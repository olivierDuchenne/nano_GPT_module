# Nano GPT Module

This package is a module version of Andrej Karpathy's nano GPT. It is designed to be easier to install and use, allowing for training and sampling to be called as functions.

The code in this module is closely aligned with the explanations provided in Andrej Karpathy's YouTube tutorials on GPT. Minimal modifications have been made to ensure that users can follow along with the videos while using this module. This should facilitate a better learning experience and allow users to see the practical implementation of concepts discussed in the tutorials.

This package is primarily aimed for educational purposes. It provides a simplified interface to the functionalities of GPT, making it accessible for learning and experimentation with transformer models. Users can easily train their own mini GPTs on custom datasets and generate text based on the trained models.

Please note that due to its educational focus, this package may not be suitable for production-level applications or large-scale data processing. It is optimized for ease of understanding and use rather than for performance or scalability.
